Here\u2019s some things that we noticed about the card writing/scanning process when using an iPhone: Place the card horizontally across the front or back of the phone, near the top of the device but not flush with the top, just below that. Try to approach the phone with the card flatter to the phone Vary the speed, maybe slower or faster. Wait for the checkmark or error and the window to disappear, sometimes it just takes a long time Sometimes the card will scan but not all the data will be read from it If it fails, try it again a few times. After 3 fails, back out to the card screen and click \u201cLink to Card\u201d again. Network speed or errors may cause this step to fail but the most likely cause is a bad scan of the card on your phone. Make sure the card/playlist details have fully loaded into the app before clicking the \u201cLink to Card\u201d button. The longer the playlist (meaning more files or duration), the more likely it is to fail. This seems silly because the same exact amount of data is being written to the card regardless of the content in the playlist, but we\u2019ve noticed a direct correlation between more tracks -> more fails Try not to bend the card when scanning it. Some phone cases raise the edges from the screen so if you press in the center of the card it may sit on both sides of the phone and flex in the middle. Have you been scanning a lot of cards? Or adding lots to your library? Or doomscrolling through the Discover tabs? Your app may just be bogged down. Force-quit it or reboot your phone and try again.","title":"Tips for scanning MYO cards with your phone"},{"location":"guides/tips_for_scanning_myo_cards_with_your_phone/#tips-for-scanning-myo-cards-with-your-phone","text":"Do you feel like sometimes the MYO card scans really quickly when trying to link a playlist or Club card but then other times it fails to link a lot more often?

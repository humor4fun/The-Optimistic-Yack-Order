Sites https://lucida.to - This is an in-browser audio ripper that pulls music down from the various major streaming sites (Spotify, Deezer, etc). You can pull down individual tracks or whole albums, in a variety of audio qualities, and you can use Lucida\u2019s built-in search by either artist or album to find what you want, or provide a direct link. Will be higher quality than ripping from YouTube (unless you select for a lower quality ofc). Please note that at the moment Lucida has been having reliability issues (which is deeply unfortunate because it's great when it works! haha) https://spotifydown.com/ - This is an in-browser audio ripper that pulls music down specifically/only from Spotify. I\u2019ve added this as a Lucida alternative as this is the downloader you\u2019ll most often see people mention when it comes to Spotify, and I\u2019ve seen it suggested many times in the Yoto subreddit. I prefer Lucida as Spotify Down is not searchable\u2013you must provide the link yourself\u2013but it is a lot simpler than Lucida to use and may be less intimidating. I have also not yet confirmed if this is pulling the audio directly from Spotify, or content-matching the songs to another site (usually YouTube) and ripping them that way, which would result in an inferior audio quality and the possibility for downloading the wrong songs (though I suspect that is the case), so please double-check MP3s you rip with this to make sure the songs are correct until I have a chance to give it a better look! Please note this website does have ads! So please consider using an ad-blocker or being careful with your clicks. https://cnvmp3.com/ - An in-browser audio-ripper for YouTube video audio. I haven't tested it yet myself, but I\u2019ve seen it recommended. It has no ads. I probably wouldn't use this for commercial music due to the aforementioned potential quality issues (though I don't think there'd be much of an audible difference) and the fact that it doesn't support playlists (I've got a program that does in the software tools section), but it would be good for content specifically from YouTube creators or book-reads/audiobooks people have uploaded. https://podcasttomp3.com - Downloads episodes of podcasts\u2013useful if you want only certain episodes, or you need earlier episodes than Yoto\u2019s built-in podcast interface is able to grab. I haven\u2019t had a chance to test this much yet, but it seems promising! It does appear to have a limitation of how far back it can grab episodes for long podcasts, so it may not be suitable for podcasts that have multiple years worth of episodes. Software Mediahuman YouTube to MP3 Downloader - Free (and ad-free!) software that takes individual or playlist links from YouTube (and some other websites) and downloads them as MP3s. Quickest and easiest option I\u2019ve found for YouTube ripping, since it does whole playlists and can be run in the background. However, despite listing support for Spotify I have noticed that it tries to match Spotify content to YouTube and pull it down from there, so at the moment I can\u2019t recommend it for use with Spotify until I figure out if there\u2019s a way to get it to use it as a direct source (as it's my understanding that YouTube audio is typically lower quality than that of music streaming). Video Download Helper - A browser add-on that will rip any streaming video or audio from pretty much any webpage. If you have some streaming content and don\u2019t know what to download it with, this is always worth a try. Can be used as an in-browser solution to pull from YouTube* (not recommended as it requires conversion), but its main point of interest for Yoto MYOs is the ability to rip the MP3s of audiobooks you\u2019ve rented from Libby if they are playing in your browser. I have not yet tested this with subscription video streaming services (eg Netlifx, Disney+), Audible, etc, as I don\u2019t have the subscriptions, so if anyone gives it a go I\u2019d love to know the results! *Chrome blocks YouTube video downloading, so this feature only works in other browsers. Mediahuman Audio Converter - If you already have audio but it\u2019s in the wrong format, this will quickly batch-convert most audio formats into MP3 so you can use them with Yoto (I have even successfully used it for the fussy M4B format). Audacity - Free audio editing software. If you need to edit some audio down into chapters/smaller pieces, this is what to use, but there is a learning curve. Soulseek - This is where I get most of my files. That said, I wouldn\u2019t recommend this for anyone without a moderate level of familiarity with computers/piracy. If you have an understanding of torrents/torrenting, then this is appropriate for you. If you don\u2019t then you\u2019ll probably have a better time with YouTube ripping and such. Soulseek is a peer-to-peer file-sharing network/client, aimed largely at sharing music but I have found a fair amount of audiobook content on here as well. It only shows the files of people who are currently online, so searching at different hours/days will give different results.

When it comes to downloading audio from Spotify, the best option I have found so far is to use Lucida.to (which also supports several other music streaming websites). Lucida Lucida.to is a simple to use audio ripper that works in your internet browser (computer or mobile). You can give it the direct link to a song or album if you already have it on hand, or you can just type the name of the artist or album into the search. It pulls up individual songs first\u2013if you want to download a whole album at once, just scroll past those and the albums will be at the bottom of the search results. Once you\u2019ve selected what you want to download, it will give you different options for the quality of the audio. You\u2019re looking for 320kbps MP3 (you can also use lower quality MP3s for MYO if you prefer. I don\u2019t know all the technical aspects of any limitations Yoto might put on the audio output, so I can\u2019t say for sure highest quality makes a difference. It\u2019s rare to run into the size limit on a playlist before hitting the track limit though, so I always like to start with the highest quality just in case). If you\u2019re downloading a whole album at once*, it will provide you with a .zip file, which is all the MP3s of the album condensed into one file for easier downloading. You will need to \u201cunzip\u201d it using the file extractor on your computer. Mac users are on their own here, as I do not have any familiarity with Mac, but for Windows you need to opposite-click the .zip file to bring up the context menu and select \u201cextract all\u201d which will make you a folder containing all of the MP3s you downloaded, which can then be uploaded to a MYO playlist using the in-browser My Yoto website , which will sync to your phone for actual card linking. *Please note I have not tested whole-album downloading on mobile. I am not sure if this works due to the ZIP files. Start by opening up Lucida, and pasting in your URL or typing out your search query: I\u2019ve decided to do a search for the Bluey album \u201cDance Mode\u201d. You now need to select a service to source the audio from. It doesn\u2019t actually have to be Spotify. Deezer is an excellent first choice, especially for mainstream/commercial music. Amazon Music should work as well, but I haven\u2019t tested it yet. You can see here I chose Deezer: It also automatically filled in the last menu for me, which is an option of the server you will be downloading the audio from. You can pick any option here, it does not need to be the one that matches your country. You can now press \u201cGo!\u201d to get your search results: As you can see I\u2019ve turned up individual songs first. I\u2019m not interested in those, I\u2019d like the whole album, so I\u2019ll scroll down to the bottom: It\u2019s actually found two Bluey Dance Mode albums. Not sure what that\u2019s about but it\u2019s the first one I\u2019m looking for, so I\u2019ll click the title of it to go to the download page: Here\u2019s where Lucida starts to get visually overwhelming for people who aren\u2019t very tech-confident! Haha. Don\u2019t worry though, you don\u2019t need most of this. All you need to do is make sure the \u201cConvert to\u201d dropdown says \u201cMP3\u201d (you can choose whatever quality you like next to that, but 320kbps is the best one), and then you can press \u201cdownload full album\u201d to start the download process. It will now start downloading and converting each track one by one, so you\u2019ll have to be a little patient! It doesn\u2019t take very long.

SpotifyDown SpotifyDown is also a simple to use audio ripper for browsers, even more simple than Lucida. You can give it a direct link to a song, album or playlist and it will provide a list of MP3 downloads, or the option to download all the tracks at once. I would recommend people with minimal tech confidence use SpotifyDown over Lucida due to the simpler interface, however I believe SpotifyDown is likely less reliable in the quality of the MP3s it provides and also could potentially result in content mis-matches, so please listen to any audio you download with it before adding it to your Yoto to check if it\u2019s correct and you\u2019re happy with the quality. TLDR it\u2019s a lower-quality tool than Lucida, but the trade-off is ease of use. Start by grabbing the sharing link of the album or playlist you want to download.

It also requires wifi and bluetooth, or NFC (if you don\u2019t know what NFC is don't worry about it\u2013wifi is just fine!). This guide will also assume you have already downloaded the app, and have connected your Yoto to it. It is available on mobile and tablet devices on both iOS and Android, and should be in your app store of choice (iTunes, Google Play, etc). Instructions on linking your Yoto are in the app itself. This guide will also assume you already have a Yoto account, and a playlist ready to be linked. If you need to learn how to make a playlist, please see the Making a MYO Playlist section. To link a MYO card, you will need to open the app on your smart device of choice (I use a Samsung minitab, so screenshots will be of the android tablet app, but it should look the same across devices), and navigate to the \u201cLibrary\u201d tab from the menu across the bottom of the app. By default this will open to your library of purchased Yoto cards. To get to your MYO playlists, look to the row of coloured tabs above the card thumbnails, and select \u201cPlaylists\u201d to get to the MYO category. Here you can see the Bluey playlist I made in the MYO Playlist tutorial, alongside several other playlists I\u2019ve already made. I\u2019ll be linking the Bluey playlist, but you can pick whichever of your own playlists that you like. If you scroll down to the bottom of the playlist, you\u2019ll see options for \u201cAdd Audio\u201d and \u201cLink to a Card\u201d. Add audio is for editing the playlist. We will press \u201cLink to a Card\u201d for now. I actually don\u2019t have my Yoto here with me as I\u2019m taking the screenshots for this, so as you can see it is greyed out. In order for it to be available, you need to have your Yoto turned on and connected to wifi, which should return the button to its normal colour, which I believe is orange. You would then want to insert a blank MYO card (or one you want to overwrite the content of) into the card slot of your Yoto player, and press the \u201cUse Your Yoto Player\u201d button, which will use wifi and Bluetooth to link the the playlist you\u2019ve made to the MYO card. Please note you can write and rewrite a MYO card as many times and as often as you like! They do not run out of uses, and rewriting one won't delete the playlist that was originally on it, that will still be stored in your playlist library for later use unless you purposefully delete it. Now, for people using modern smartphones rather than a dinky tablet like myself, you will have a second option for linking on this screen that I am unable to screenshot, which I imagine will be labelled \u201cUse your phone\u201d or possibly \u201cuse NFC\u201d. This is because modern phones have NFC built into them, meaning the phone can write to the card directly if the card is held close to/against it. I\u2019m sure if you have this button and press it, the app will explain to you exactly how to position the card. It's possible (likely even) that linking via NFC can be done without wifi. As I don\u2019t have an NFC device I'm not able to test this\u2013if anyone has a concrete answer please let me know!

Please note the player needs to maintain a wifi connection to download content. If it is downloading, there should be a cloud icon on the screen. It doesn\u2019t take very long to download if you have a good connection.

If you\u2019re not currently logged in, you will need to do that first. Once you are logged in, it looks like this: Here I have two playlists I\u2019ve made already, but If you haven\u2019t made a playlist yet, you\u2019ll only have the large blue button. You\u2019ll want to click it to start making your first playlist. This is the playlist screen. You have two options for adding audio to your playlist, \u201cAdd Audio\u201d which is for adding MP3s, or \u201cAdd Stream\u201d which is for adding radio stations (podcasts cannot be added from this screen). We will cover radio stations in a second guide. For now you will want to start by making a playlist of MP3s. If you do not have MP3s ready, please see the other information in this document for how to acquire MP3s and then come back here. If you have your MP3s ready, read on. Right now we want to: - Name your playlist (this is mandatory in order to save it). - Upload a cover image so you can easily identify this playlist both here and in the app (optional) - And add our MP3s I will be assuming you know how to do a Google Images search and save an image to your PC in a place you know where to find it. With that in mind, all you need to do to add a cover image is press the cloud-shaped \u201cUpload Art\u201d button, and select your image in your computer\u2019s file browser. You can also use the \u201cRandom Art\u201d button to have Yoto select a random cover image for you from its default options, but I find these get same-y really fast. Now you will need to add your MP3s. Yoto helpfully supports batch uploading, so this is very quick and easy. For this tutorial, I will be making a playlist for the Bluey music album, as I know that is a very popular MYO. You can see here I\u2019ve selected the entire album\u2019s worth of files at once for batch uploading. Yoto will now go through the process of uploading all of them one after the other, in alphabetical order. This takes a few minutes. If you want to upload multiple books/albums/etc to the same card, you\u2019ll want to wait for the first one to finish uploading all of its tracks before adding another, or it starts to add them simultaneously and the tracks will be interspersed rather than in the correct order. A few things to note: - If any tracks do end up in the wrong order , you can click and hold on the three blue lines next to each track to drag them around and re-order them. - If you need to delete any tracks, you can do so with the \u201c...\u201d icon to the far right of the track. The \u201c...\u201d menu will be discussed in further detail below. - You can rename tracks by simply clicking into the track name and backspacing/typing accordingly. Now that we have our tracks, we now want to: - Wait for Yoto to finish uploading all of the tracks - (optional: add a second/third/etc set of tracks) - Add icons to our tracks so they can be identified - Finalize our playlist options Now that we\u2019ve waited for our tracks to finish uploading, it\u2019s time to add icons! We will do this by pressing the multi-coloured + symbol next to each track name. It looks like this: And will open the following icon interface: As you can see, Yoto has a large library of icons already built in, and you will often be able to find something suitable without needing to add your own icons. However if you are doing a MYO of something like Bluey, where you might want icons of the specific characters, then you\u2019ll want to visit Yoto Icons , a site where other Yoto users upload the icons they themselves have drawn. They have a wide variety of both character icons and general icons, so it\u2019s always worth a look if you don\u2019t see something in the Yoto interface that grabs you! You can upload custom icons by going to the \u201cMy Icons\u201d tab of the icons interface. You can see here I\u2019ve decided to upload an icon of Bluey. And before I select it, I have also checked the \u201cApply to all tracks\u201d box, which will put the same icon on every track on the playlist without my having to do it manually. As the icon is the only thing on the player that indicates what song is selected, I don\u2019t recommend doing this for children though (I am just doing it for the tutorial). As you can see, all of my tracks now have this icon of Bluey. Please note you do not have to give tracks an icon in order to save your playlist. It\u2019s possible to save a playlist without adding icons/without adding all the icons, if you need to pause and save your work before you have time to add them all, or you just don\u2019t want to use them. Tracks without icons will just display the coloured + sign when playing on the Yoto. Now we will move on to finalizing our playlist options! There\u2019s actually two things we can do here, but we\u2019ll start with the most obvious, this little panel of options at the bottom of the playlist interface: Always play from start : By default, Yoto cards resume playing from wherever they were last stopped when inserted into a Yoto player, so that if your child is listening to a story it will continue where they left it. Selecting this option will disable that, so when the card is inserted it always plays from the very beginning no matter where it left off. Shuffle tracks each time played : It\u2019s Shuffle, just like in your music player/streaming of choice! When inserted, the card will start at a random track, and it will also pick a random track when skipping between songs. This also applies to turning the knob to seek certain tracks\u2013they will appear in a random order. Excellent for music cards, but you definitely need to make sure all the icons are unique to avoid frustration! Hide track numbers : When turning the knob on the Yoto to seek tracks, it displays the number of the track overtop of the picture icon, so you can see how far ahead you\u2019re seeking. It is useful to disable this for very young children, so they can view the icon more clearly, since the numbers will not yet be useful to them. Now we have the second, more hidden options for finalizing our playlist, the \u201c...\u201d icon next to each track: Which opens this small additional menu: These settings are per individual track. By default, every track will be set to \u201ccontinue to next track\u201d, which is normal play. However if you like, you can change any given track to need a button press interaction, or to loop by selecting the Repeat track option, which would be useful if you are making cards of background noise or music, such as for sleeping. This is also how you can delete tracks if needed. Once we\u2019re happy with all our playlist settings, we will now press the large orange \u201cCreate\u201d icon, which will save the playlist to our account. And now it should be in our playlists! As seen below: We can now move on to linking a playlist to a MYO card .", "title": "Making a MYO Playlist - Using a Computer"}, {"location": "myo/guides/Getting%20Started%20with%20MYO%20Playlists/playlist_computer/#making-a-myo-playlist-using-a-computer", "text": "Author: u/playchime In your web browser of choice, follow this link to the My Yoto website .

Tracks without icons will just display the coloured + sign when playing on the Yoto. Now we will move on to finalizing our playlist options! There\u2019s actually two things we can do here, but we\u2019ll start with the most obvious, this little panel of options at the bottom of the playlist interface: Always play from start : By default, Yoto cards resume playing from wherever they were last stopped when inserted into a Yoto player, so that if your child is listening to a story it will continue where they left it. Selecting this option will disable that, so when the card is inserted it always plays from the very beginning no matter where it left off. Shuffle tracks each time played : It\u2019s Shuffle, just like in your music player/streaming of choice! When inserted, the card will start at a random track, and it will also pick a random track when skipping between songs. This also applies to turning the knob to seek certain tracks\u2013they will appear in a random order. Excellent for music cards, but you definitely need to make sure all the icons are unique to avoid frustration! Hide track numbers : When turning the knob on the Yoto to seek tracks, it displays the number of the track overtop of the picture icon, so you can see how far ahead you\u2019re seeking. It is useful to disable this for very young children, so they can view the icon more clearly, since the numbers will not yet be useful to them. Now we have the second, more hidden options for finalizing our playlist, the \u201c...\u201d icon next to each track: Which opens this small additional menu: These settings are per individual track. By default, every track will be set to \u201ccontinue to next track\u201d, which is normal play. However if you like, you can change any given track to need a button press interaction, or to loop by selecting the Repeat track option, which would be useful if you are making cards of background noise or music, such as for sleeping. This is also how you can delete tracks if needed. Once we\u2019re happy with all our playlist settings, we will now press the large orange \u201cCreate\u201d icon, which will save the playlist to our account. And now it should be in our playlists! As seen below: We can now move on to linking a playlist to a MYO card .", "title": "Making a MYO Playlist - Using a Computer"}, {"location": "myo/guides/Getting%20Started%20with%20MYO%20Playlists/playlist_yoto_app/", "text": "Making a MYO Playlist - Using the Yoto App Using the app is a bit finickier than the computer and is missing several options, so I don\u2019t recommend it. If you\u2019re restricted to mobile, it would be best to still use the in-browser version of My Yoto if possible (you should theoretically be able to do this and follow along with the computer tutorial , but I still need to test this). But if for some reason you must use the app, or it\u2019s just more comfortable for you, I\u2019ve made a tutorial anyhow. Please note this guide assumes you have already signed up for a Yoto account. Please also note you do not yet need to own a Yoto device to be able to sign up and make playlists! I totally recommend signing up before purchasing so you can try out making a playlist to see how you feel about the process/using the app/etc. You can also start making them while your Yoto is in transit to you so you have playlists ready to be listened to when it arrives! We will start by opening our Yoto app, and navigating to the \u201cPlaylists\u201d section by using the row of coloured tabs above the card thumbnails. As you can see I\u2019ve already got several playlists here: If this is your first playlist, you\u2019ll likely only have the large blue button, which we will press to start making our first playlist, giving us this screen: You\u2019ll want to give your playlist a name, as that\u2019s mandatory to continue. I\u2019m going to be making a playlist for Charlie and the Chooclate Factory, so that\u2019s the name I\u2019ve put in for mine: If you want to add a description with more information about the audio you\u2019re going to use, then you can do that as well. You can also press the \u201cRandom Artwork\u201d button at the top right to generate a random card cover from Yoto\u2019s built-in designs. We\u2019ll discuss the covers a bit more further down. For now you\u2019ll want to press \u201cSave\u201d and move on to the next screen: This is where we\u2019ll be adding our audio. For this guide we\u2019re going to be making a playlist of MP3s, so you want to press the big green button. At this point, everyone\u2019s experience will be slightly different depending on what mobile phone/tablet you are using, as you\u2019re opening up the file menu of your phone. I\u2019m using a samsung minitab, which looks like this: I\u2019ll then be using the file browser to navigate to where I\u2019ve stored my MP3s: In my case I\u2019ve got them all in one folder and it\u2019s the only thing in the folder, so I\u2019ll press the \u201cSelect all\u201d button at the top left. Please keep in mind that Yoto will make the playlist using the order the tracks are displayed here, so you\u2019ll want to use whatever sorting options you have to get them in line first (though you can manually sort playlists as well, we\u2019ll cover that too). Once we\u2019ve got our tracks selected, press the \u201cDone\u201d button at the bottom: Which will bring us back to the Yoto interface: It takes a bit of time to upload files to the app, so you\u2019ll have to give it a couple minutes. When it\u2019s done all the tracks will be green: We can then press the \u201cDone\u201d button here as well. Now, the Yoto app is a bit quirky in that it\u2019s going to actually exit the editing interface now even though we\u2019re not done yet. So we need to press that pencil button at the top right to keep editing. This screen has a lot of different options, so let me walk you through them: - Top Left, Randomize Artwork: generates a random card art from Yoto\u2019s built in designs. - Top Right, Add Your Own Artwork: This is where we\u2019ll upload a custom card art from an image we have saved to our phone. - Left, Three blue lines beside each track: Hold down on these and drag to re-order tracks. - Left, Rainbow plus sign beside each track: Add a custom icon to each track - Right, Three blue dots beside each track: This opens up the track options menu, which is additional settings that are per track. This is not the same menu as you can access on the in-browser My Yoto space. More on that later. This is how you delete a track from a playlist, as well as re-name it. If you scroll all the way to the bottom of your playlist you\u2019ll also see \u201cMore options on the website\u201d: which will open the in-browser My Yoto space where if you scroll to the bottom of your playlist there you can access the Playlist Options mentioned in the computer tutorial. We\u2019ll cover these at the bottom of this tutorial. I\u2019m not gonna lie, the app is a little bit of a mess in this regard. Anyway, for now we want to add icons to our tracks! So we\u2019ll press the rainbow-coloured plus icon next to our first track name to open up the icons menu: If you have any custom icons uploaded, those will show up first. Otherwise Yoto has many icons already available to choose from. I\u2019m going to select this one of a chocolate bar and what may be a wedge of cheese but works well enough here as a golden ticket haha. Once I select it I am also going to press \u201capply to all tracks\u201d as I don\u2019t want to pick an icon for each individual track, but you can choose either one! That will make every track icon the same and save me from having to apply it to each of my tracks: If Yoto doesn\u2019t have an icon available that suits the playlist you\u2019re making, such as a character playlist (Bluey, Peppa, etc), then you\u2019ll want to head over to Yoto Icons to download some more options to upload as custom icons. Mobile phones tend to save transparent images with a white background, however, so you may need to add your custom icons using the in-browser My Yoto space on your computer. But you can certainly give it a try on your phone and see how it goes for you. In that case from the icons menu you need to press the blue \u201cAdd an Icon\u201d in the top right: And it will give you the choice to select an image from your camera roll or your file storage. Now that we\u2019ve got our icons, let\u2019s cover the additional menus. I'll start with the in-app track settings menu, the three dots to the right of each track: As you can see we only have three options here, and one of them is redundant. - Rename Audio - change the track name. You can also do this by just tapping the track name field and beginning to type. - Change Pixel Art - change the track icon. This can also be done by just pressing the icon already on the track. - Remove from this playlist - this deletes the track. I\u2019m not sure why it specifies remove from this playlist\u2013it's not storing it anywhere else, it just deletes the track. - Cancel - this just closes the menu At this point there's nothing else you can do in the app itself so once you're happy with all your track info, you can save the playlist changes! At this point you have two options: you can move right on to linking your playlist to a card, or you can explore the additional options available to you in the in-browser My Yoto space. If you want to link your card, you can skip ahead to linking a playlist to a myo card . Otherwise, this is where we really get into the limitations of the app and why using the in-browser space is unfortunately superior. To open the in-browser version of your playlist, scroll down to the bottom of the playlist while you\u2019re still in the editing screen, and select \u201cMore options on the website\u201d: As mentioned earlier, this is where you\u2019ll be able to access this additional menu not present in the app: Always play from start: By default, Yoto cards resume playing from wherever they were last stopped when inserted into a Yoto player, so that if your child is listening to a story it will continue where they left it. Selecting this option will disable that, so when the card is inserted it always plays from the very beginning no matter where it left off.

However, as well as this menu Yoto makes obvious to you, there\u2019s also an additional menu not present in the app that can be accessed here, which is the non-app version of the track settings menu, which can be accessed with the three dots to the right of each track: These settings are per individual track.

However if you like, you can change any given track to need a button press interaction, or to loop by selecting the Repeat track option, which would be useful if you are making cards of background noise or music, such as for sleeping. Delete track is also still here, now more clearly named. Stuff you change in either of these menus will still apply to the in-app version of your playlist.

They also can\u2019t be added in the app\u2013going to add one in the app will just open My Yoto space in your web browser, so for this guide, phones/tablets and PCs can follow the same tutorial. Adding podcasts to MYO through the podcast interface in this way rather than by downloading the episodes allows Yoto to automatically refresh the card when new episodes come out, which is very handy. We\u2019ll start by covering how to get to the podcasts section of My Yoto space on mobile, then computers, and then the instructions will be shared after that point. If you\u2019re using your phone or tablet, you can start by opening up your app, and then selecting \u201cPodcasts\u201d from the row of coloured tabs above the card icons: Now press the big blue button to add a podcast. This will open the My Yoto space in the web browser of your phone or tablet, already open to the podcasts tab/adding a new one: If you\u2019re on a computer/otherwise in-browser, then you\u2019ll want to go to the My Yoto website directly. You\u2019ll find the \u201cPodcasts\u201d section right next to \u201cPlaylists\u201d up at the top left of your screen, by the Yoto logo: As you can see I already have two podcasts here (I\u2019m an adult so these are appropriate selections aha), but unless you\u2019ve already added some from Yoto\u2019s in-app selections, then you\u2019ll just have the big blue button, which we can press to start adding a new podcast. From this point on, the instructions for computers and tablets/phones are exactly the same. To add a podcast to Yoto, you need an RSS link. It\u2019s not important to understand the specifics of it, just to have it, so the easiest thing to do is to use a website that will find the correct link for you, such as Get RSS Feed . All you need to do is paste in the link to a podcast from wherever you were listening to it (Spotify, iTunes, etc), and it will find the correct link to use with Yoto. For the sake of a child-friendly example, I\u2019m using the Arthur podcast . As you can see I\u2019ve pasted the iTunes url into Get RSS: And then pressed \u201cFind RSS Feed\u201d: We can now press \u201cCopy RSS\u201d and navigate back to the My Yoto podcasts page, and paste it in: You can also add a custom icon by pressing the rainbow coloured button to the left to open the icon interface: And then press \u201cGet Podcast Details\u201d Yoto will then find all the episodes (or as many as it can keep track of\u2013there is a limit of only the 25 most recent episodes), and you can press \u201cSave\u201d to make them available for linking to a MYO card. Linking the podcasts to a MYO card also works slightly differently than linking usual MYO playlists. We will still open up our Yoto app and use the bottom menu to go to the library, but you then need to select \u201cPodcasts\u201d from the row of coloured tabs above the playlist thumbnails: You can then select the podcast you want to link to a MYO, and the process from there is the same as with playlists. Please note: Currently it is not possible to select which episodes of a podcast Yoto pulls, or to link individual episodes to a card. If you want more control over podcast content, you will need to download it first and go through the usual MYO playlist-making process. Additionally, it is possible to further customize podcast playlists as if they were standard MYO playlists by using the app. This is something I've only just discovered and am still experimenting with. If you're new to Yoto you may want to ignore this for now. If not, start by going to your podcasts tab and selecting a podcast: At the top right of the screen, you will see an icon of three stacked dots. Pressing it opens up this menu along the bottom of the screen: Selecting the edit option here will open up the same playlist editor we\u2019re able to use for standard MYO cards, which will allow for sorting the tracks in a custom order, adding individualized track icons, and even editing the title, cover image, and podcast description. It can then even be opened up in the My Yoto space using the \u201cmore options on website\u201d link to access all the usual track and playlist settings not present in the app like looping a track or shuffling the playlist. As I'm still experimenting with this, I don't yet know how any of these affect the podcast in the long term\u2013it is possible they will disable its ability to automatically update with new episodes. It\u2019s a neat thing to mess around with though! Currently I expect editing podcasts in this way with the usual MYO editor turns them into standard MYO playlists. This is reflected in My Yoto space\u2013a podcast I edited in this way moved from my podcasts tab into my playlists tab\u2013but unusually is not reflected in the app, where it remained in my podcasts tab. So I can't say for sure! This potentially has merit as a way of circumventing the need to download podcast episodes as well if you just want a playlist of your favourites, as I expect with access to all the features of the playlist editor you could also delete episodes, but ofc there wouldn't be a way to grab earlier episodes than whatever you started with. Either way, I haven't tried deleting episodes yet.

As you can see I\u2019ve pasted the iTunes url into Get RSS: And then pressed \u201cFind RSS Feed\u201d: We can now press \u201cCopy RSS\u201d and navigate back to the My Yoto podcasts page, and paste it in: You can also add a custom icon by pressing the rainbow coloured button to the left to open the icon interface: And then press \u201cGet Podcast Details\u201d Yoto will then find all the episodes (or as many as it can keep track of\u2013there is a limit of only the 25 most recent episodes), and you can press \u201cSave\u201d to make them available for linking to a MYO card. Linking the podcasts to a MYO card also works slightly differently than linking usual MYO playlists. We will still open up our Yoto app and use the bottom menu to go to the library, but you then need to select \u201cPodcasts\u201d from the row of coloured tabs above the playlist thumbnails: You can then select the podcast you want to link to a MYO, and the process from there is the same as with playlists. Please note: Currently it is not possible to select which episodes of a podcast Yoto pulls, or to link individual episodes to a card. If you want more control over podcast content, you will need to download it first and go through the usual MYO playlist-making process. Additionally, it is possible to further customize podcast playlists as if they were standard MYO playlists by using the app. This is something I've only just discovered and am still experimenting with. If you're new to Yoto you may want to ignore this for now. If not, start by going to your podcasts tab and selecting a podcast: At the top right of the screen, you will see an icon of three stacked dots. Pressing it opens up this menu along the bottom of the screen: Selecting the edit option here will open up the same playlist editor we\u2019re able to use for standard MYO cards, which will allow for sorting the tracks in a custom order, adding individualized track icons, and even editing the title, cover image, and podcast description. It can then even be opened up in the My Yoto space using the \u201cmore options on website\u201d link to access all the usual track and playlist settings not present in the app like looping a track or shuffling the playlist. As I'm still experimenting with this, I don't yet know how any of these affect the podcast in the long term\u2013it is possible they will disable its ability to automatically update with new episodes. It\u2019s a neat thing to mess around with though! Currently I expect editing podcasts in this way with the usual MYO editor turns them into standard MYO playlists. This is reflected in My Yoto space\u2013a podcast I edited in this way moved from my podcasts tab into my playlists tab\u2013but unusually is not reflected in the app, where it remained in my podcasts tab. So I can't say for sure! This potentially has merit as a way of circumventing the need to download podcast episodes as well if you just want a playlist of your favourites, as I expect with access to all the features of the playlist editor you could also delete episodes, but ofc there wouldn't be a way to grab earlier episodes than whatever you started with. Either way, I haven't tried deleting episodes yet. I'm gonna mess around with all of this over the next few days, but it was too interesting not to add now!", "title": "Adding Podcasts to MYO"}, {"location": "myo/guides/Radio%20Stations%20for%20MYO/adding_radio_to_myo/", "text": "Adding Radio to MYO Please note I keep a document with links to radio link databases and selected individual stations here .

One of the first things we did when writing tools was to write a \"scrub_personal_data\" function to delete this info from the cached data so that its not even stored for processing later. Its not required so we don't keep it in the data cache. We check the email address only to determine \"is this from YOTO, or a user\" and then \"if its a user, make sure we give the credits/points to the author of the playlist and not the uploader\" Don\u2019t see what you are looking for?

This seems silly because the same exact amount of data is being written to the card regardless of the content in the playlist, but we\u2019ve noticed a direct correlation between more tracks -> more fails Try not to bend the card when scanning it. Some phone cases raise the edges from the screen so if you press in the center of the card it may sit on both sides of the phone and flex in the middle. Have you been scanning a lot of cards? Or adding lots to your library? Or doomscrolling through the Discover tabs? Your app may just be bogged down.

The community interest and response continues to be overwhelmingly positive. Thank you for that! Over the past few months a small group of dedicated folks have been looking at what is out there and trying to come up with a strategy for how we can collect, catalog, and share it. Cheers, The TOYO team. What has changed? The Card Link Form has been rebuilt to track user submissions. Access to the library has been restricted while we significantly restructure the data and storage systems. This stuff isn't free though. We have spent money on hosting and a LOT of our own time building tools and cleaning up data. When we reopen, access will be limited to those people who submit 5 or more unique cards (that means 'new to the library'; MYO cards don't count currently). ALERT: if you submitted cards in the past, you are welcome to re-submit the same link and we will be able to merge the two submissions to give you credit. We are also working on merging card data and store data this week to enrich the library with lots more searchable and filterable features. There's some very interesting things that come out of this joined dataset. This library will remain solely focused on Yoto formatted content. The primary and most valuable content type will be official cards. Physical cards and Digital cards sometimes are different, and often different depending on the geographical location they came from. Playlists you've built as MYO cards are second-class submissions and are only valuable contributions if they contain customized icons, track names, description, and card artwork. ETA for re-opening is November 13th If you'd like to be invited to access The Optimistic Yack Order Archive, you must submit five (5) unique entries to that have not already been checked in (first come first serve). There is no limit to the number of participants; it might become harder to find unique cards as the population grows. Directions Fill out this form and submit it 5 or more times. Once your 5 entries have been confirmed as unique, your membership will be confirmed. This can take up to 2 weeks depending on our availability. After confirmation, you'll be granted access to the full library of resources that we have built. Invalid entries will be rejected. MYO playlists will NOT count towards the official unique entries. Tips Check out the LIBRARY CONTENTS to see the list of what we already have . Check the WANTED LIST to see some items we know we are missing. Other valid items are very likely out there, but the wanted list is a set of things we know we don't have and would be valid. To claim credit for cards you sent in before we began tracking email addresses, just send it in again with a note in the URL field and we can correlate it.

See other FAQs, details, and warnings about purchasing from other Yoto geographical locations. Warning: If you use a hotel or random address, the cards will show up in your library but you will not receive the physical cards and this puts you at risk of losing those cards should someone find them and scan them into their own app, or return to Yoto, etc. Proceed at your own risk.

General Yoto Questions What is the difference between a full size and mini Yoto Player? I just bought my first Yoto Player. What do I need to do to get setup? I want to gift a Yoto Player, is there anything special I need to do? What is the MYO Studio Chrome Extension? What is the Yoto Audio Player browser extension? What is the Yoto Club? Is it worth the money? Can I share my referral link? Using your Yoto Player Can you set a sleep timer on Yoto Players? Kind of, sort of. Yoto has the ability to set a \u201cnight time\u201d mode, which has the ability to limit the volume to 0, which effectively makes it mute. However, there is only a single schedule for night time mode, so you would not be able to set a separate volume limit prior to \u201cnight time.\u201d An alternative would be to make use of Home Assistant to schedule the volume limitations to change at different times. Tutorials for integrating Home Assistant and Scheduling Tasks are coming soon. Can you set a wake up alarm on Yoto Players? Why won\u2019t my Yoto connect to my hotspot? Your hotspot may be set to 5gHz and I believe the Yoto player can only connect to 2.5gHz. You should be able to go into your device\u2019s hotspot settings and see what gHz it is putting out. Additionally, Yoto Players can only connect to WiFi connections that have required passwords, so ensure that that option is enabled on your hotspot. Why won\u2019t my podcasts play? If you know that the RSS feed and card are working correctly, the most common reason is that the player does not have access to the internet. Unlike normal playlists and books, podcasts are not downloaded to the Yoto Player itself, and require near constant internet access to work. Hardware Can I purchase NFC cards from sources other than Yoto? Yes! See our tutorials on how to source these cards , as well as using them . Are Yoto Players smart home compatible? Yes!

However, you need to make sure the instructions have been saved to your card collection in your app before overwriting it, or you\u2019ll lose the instructions forever! If the instruction card is in your library, it looks like this: Cards: Yoto cards can be inserted in any orientation! Upside down and back to front is also fine! Yoto cards cannot be hole-punched! Because they can be inserted in any way, Yoto cards have electronics running around the whole border of the card. You cannot hole-punch them to put them on keyrings without damaging these electronics unless you\u2019re extremely careful. Even then, hole-punched cards will lose their resale value. You can see where the electronics are in the cards (can vary per card) by shining a bright light through the plastic, if you really want to have a look. You can quickly tell if your player is connected to wifi or not by its clock face! If your clock face has red numbers, it\u2019s connected to wifi. If they\u2019re white, it\u2019s not connected to wifi or has lost its connection. Alarms: Gen2, Gen 3: If you have the large Yoto, it will play any alarms you've set even when it's turned off. Great if you want to make sure the kids are up, bad if you don't want to wake the baby. Make sure if you've set an alarm and no longer want to hear it, you disable it in the app. Mini: The Yoto Mini will only play alarms when it's turned on. So if you want to use it as an alarm clock for the kids, you\u2019ll need to leave it powered on at night. What Does That Button Do? Yoto already has a button guide over here . General: Power button, long press - turn player on or off Power button, tap - pause content (if there is audio playing)/show battery charge level (if there is no audio playing). Left knob, twist - volume up and down Left knob, press - go to previous track The right knob is unique in that it's functions differ depending on whether a card is inserted or not: With card inserted: Right knob, twist - seek/scroll between tracks. You must follow this action with a button press to actually change the track. Right knob, press - go to next track/selected track if scrolling Without card inserted: Right knob single/first press - shortcut A, by default this is Yoto Daily. Right knob, double/second press - shortcut B, by default this is Yoto Radio in the daytime and Yoto Sleep Radio at night. You can change the functions of the shortcuts by opening your app, going to Settings using the menu at the bottom of the screen, selecting your Yoto player, and scrolling down until you see the \u201cRight Button Shortcuts\u201d options at the bottom of both the Daytime and Nighttime settings menus. They can be set differently for day and night, so make sure you pay attention to which one you're changing! How Do Yoto Cards work? Contrary to how you might think of them based on other formats like cassette or CD, Yoto cards do not actually hold any audio content. The only thing on a Yoto card is an instruction to the player of what content you have stored in its internal memory (or on the cloud if it hasn\u2019t yet been downloaded) that you want it to play. As such, when you first get a new Yoto card, it will require wifi access to become more than a decorative bit of plastic. When you first play a new card, it will use wifi to \u201cstream\u201d the content to the player. This is just playing it off Yoto\u2019s servers, the same as if you were listening to Spotify or YouTube, and is wifi-dependent (and also has some lag). If set up correctly, future plays will be from the internal storage of the Yoto, which is not wifi-dependent and has no lag. We\u2019ll cover getting Yoto cards downloaded to the internal memory in just a moment. Does Yoto Work Without Wifi? Yes! But only if it's set up correctly (again, we will cover this in a moment). Some features of Yoto do not work without wifi however. Content that works without wifi (when set up correctly): Purchased Yoto cards MYO playlists Yoto Daily, if the episode had a chance to update and download before the wifi access was lost* Content that does not work without wifi: Radio, including Yoto Radio and Yoto Sleep Radio Podcasts Casting content from a mobile phone *I\u2019m still testing this, but I think it's the case. I\u2019ve been successfully able to play the episodes with my wifi turned off a couple times now. Downloading Yoto Cards Also titled setting it up correctly for future use without wifi . To download a Yoto card to the internal memory, you need to follow this process: Turn the Yoto player on, and make sure it is connected to wifi (the clock face displays red numbers if the player is connected to wifi\u2013they\u2019ll be white if it\u2019s not). Place the card you want to download into the Yoto player, and let it play for a few seconds. If you have multiple cards you'd like to download, do this with each of them. Remove all cards and make sure no audio content is playing on the Yoto. You want it to be on its home screen of the clock face/sun or moon. While still connected to wifi, plug the player in to charge and leave it on for a bit. You can check if your card(s) are downloading (or if they've finished) by opening up your Yoto app, going to settings, selecting your player, and choosing \u201cAudio Download Status\u201d Both the Yoto Gen 3 and the Yoto Mini 2024 have 32GB of storage space to store downloaded content.", "title": "Yoto Basics"}, {"location": "yoto/guides/yoto_basics/#yoto-basics", "text": "", "title": "Yoto Basics"}, {"location": "yoto/guides/yoto_basics/#things-you-should-know", "text": "Free MYO Card + Instructions: The orange instructional card that comes with your Yoto is also usable as a MYO card.

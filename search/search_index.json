We are not authorized to give legal advice. When will the Archive be available? The Archive is currently accepting submission of content to backup as well as applications to access the backups. How can I access the Archive? Please see Applying to the Archive for instructions. What can be found in the archive? The Archive contains only backups of Official Yoto Cards, which is complete with chapterized audio, all icons, and cover art. To view the full content of the Archive, see the Index. How come I can only archive Official Yoto Content? The goal of this project is to only have high quality content specifically for the Yoto ecosystem. While there is significantly more \u201cgeneric\u201d audio content available, that is currently out of scope of the Archive.We want to offer an experience curated to the Yoto user, with the ability to access a full backup of their purchased content. General Yoto Questions What is the difference between a full size and mini Yoto Player? I just bought my first Yoto Player. What do I need to do to get setup? I want to gift a Yoto Player, is there anything special I need to do? What is the MYO Studio Chrome Extension? What is the Yoto Audio Player browser extension? What is the Yoto Club? Is it worth the money? Can I share my referral link? Using your Yoto Player Can you set a sleep timer on Yoto Players? Kind of, sort of. Yoto has the ability to set a \u201cnight time\u201d mode, which has the ability to limit the volume to 0, which effectively makes it mute. However, there is only a single schedule for night time mode, so you would not be able to set a separate volume limit prior to \u201cnight time.\u201d An alternative would be to make use of Home Assistant to schedule the volume limitations to change at different times. Tutorials for integrating Home Assistant and Scheduling Tasks are coming soon. Can you set a wake up alarm on Yoto Players? Why won\u2019t my Yoto connect to my hotspot? Your hotspot may be set to 5gHz and I believe the Yoto player can only connect to 2.5gHz. You should be able to go into your device\u2019s hotspot settings and see what gHz it is putting out. Additionally, Yoto Players can only connect to WiFi connections that have required passwords, so ensure that that option is enabled on your hotspot. Why won\u2019t my podcasts play? If you know that the RSS feed and card are working correctly, the most common reason is that the player does not have access to the internet. Unlike normal playlists and books, podcasts are not downloaded to the Yoto Player itself, and require near constant internet access to work. Hardware Can I purchase NFC cards from sources other than Yoto? Yes! See our tutorials on how to source these cards , as well as using them . Are Yoto Players smart home compatible? Yes! There is a Yoto Player integration available for Home Assistant . Tutorials on adding your Yoto Players are coming soon! Content The content I want is not available in the Archive. What are my options? How can I put Podcasts on a Yoto Card? This can be done on the \u201cMy Playlists\u201d page . Further tutorials on using podcasts are coming soon. Can I sell or trade cards here? No. There are other fora on the internet for Buying/Selling/Trading Yoto cards, but those activities are not allowed in the Discord server. Attempting to do so may result in administrative actions. MYO Cards & Playlists Why is my card is not linking to the playlist? Why does my audio content load to the MYO in a strange order? How can I efficiently load Icons onto my MYO playlist? Can I put my own recordings onto a Yoto card? Artwork What are the best printers for making labels? What is the \u201clibrary system\u201d?

I've found 3-4 seconds works well for most books. After the tool does its work you'll need to go through each label and verify they are correct and make adjustments as necessary. This is a tedious process but unfortunately unavoidable. Note: if you need to add a new label you can use Edit >> Labels >> Add Label at Selection or CTRL+B.

The community interest and response continues to be overwhelmingly positive. Thank you for that! Over the past few months a small group of dedicated folks have been looking at what is out there and trying to come up with a strategy for how we can collect, catalog, and share it. Cheers, The TOYO team. What has changed? The Card Link Form has been rebuilt to track user submissions. Access to the library has been restricted while we significantly restructure the data and storage systems. This stuff isn't free though. We have spent money on hosting and a LOT of our own time building tools and cleaning up data. When we reopen, access will be limited to those people who submit 5 or more unique cards (that means 'new to the library'; MYO cards don't count currently). ALERT: if you submitted cards in the past, you are welcome to re-submit the same link and we will be able to merge the two submissions to give you credit. We are also working on merging card data and store data this week to enrich the library with lots more searchable and filterable features. There's some very interesting things that come out of this joined dataset. This library will remain solely focused on Yoto formatted content. The primary and most valuable content type will be official cards. Physical cards and Digital cards sometimes are different, and often different depending on the geographical location they came from. Playlists you've built as MYO cards are second-class submissions and are only valuable contributions if they contain customized icons, track names, description, and card artwork. ETA for re-opening is November 13th If you'd like to be invited to access The Optimistic Yack Order Archive, you must submit five (5) unique entries to that have not already been checked in (first come first serve). There is no limit to the number of participants; it might become harder to find unique cards as the population grows. Directions Fill out this form and submit it 5 or more times. Once your 5 entries have been confirmed as unique, your membership will be confirmed. This can take up to 2 weeks depending on our availability. After confirmation, you'll be granted access to the full library of resources that we have built. Invalid entries will be rejected. MYO playlists will NOT count towards the official unique entries. Tips Check out the LIBRARY CONTENTS to see the list of what we already have . Check the WANTED LIST to see some items we know we are missing. Other valid items are very likely out there, but the wanted list is a set of things we know we don't have and would be valid. To claim credit for cards you sent in before we began tracking email addresses, just send it in again with a note in the URL field and we can correlate it. You can't fake this, URLs are unique per card. Join r/moreyoto on Reddit to keep track of future updates. Join the Yoto Collaborative discord to get involved in contributing and have real time access to more community members and content.","title":"October 31, 2024 Letter"},{"location":"notes/october_31_2024_letter/#october-31-2024-letter","text":"Hi, Thanks for showing your interest in the content library.
